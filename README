Fox Gnome Human Interface library (foxGHI)  08/09/2022 
============================================================

GENERAL INFO:
================
This very small library extends the FOX GUI Framework with several additional classes with the help of which
you can use top-level windows without decoration with the so-called Header bar.

The Header bar is a small bar at the top of the window that integrates the properties of the title bar,
including major control buttons such as iconify, maximize, restore, close window, and
possibly another. It also enables movement with the window using the mouse. Just like the title bar of the window can
display the app name and some additional text. It also provides space for tool buttons,
different indicators and the like, basically almost any widget can be used. Often Header bar
also contains a button with a roll-up main menu of the application.

The goal of this library is not to create a complete „Gnome 3-Like style“ for Fox, only to implement it
some - in my opinion - innovative and interesting techniques from this environment. At this time
Simple Window (FXGWindow), Header bar (FXWindowHeader) and Window Control Panel (FXWindowController) are implemented.

As stated above, the goal of this library is not to duplicate Gnome 3, but to implement those
object, I am trying to start from the Gnome 3 Standard "GHI - Gnome Human Interface", according to this one
the library also got its name.

Please note that the library is currently under development and may change at any time, although there is a 
certain effort to prevent this from happening, however, this cannot be guaranteed at this time
